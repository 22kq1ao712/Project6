            Gooey butter cake
            Butter cakes are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and flour.
             They rely on the combination of butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter.
             [11] A classic pound cake is made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour.
              Another type of butter cake that takes its name from the proportion of ingredients used is 1-2-3-4 
              cake: 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3 cups flour, and 4 eggs.[12]
               According to Beth Tartan, this cake was one of the most common among the American pioneers who settled North Carolina.</p>

Steamed sponge cake called ma lai gao
Sponge cakes (or foam cakes) are made from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. Traditional sponge cakes are leavened only with eggs.
 They rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally beaten eggs) to provide leavening, sometimes with a bit of baking powder or other chemical leaven added.
 Egg-leavened sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast.</p>
